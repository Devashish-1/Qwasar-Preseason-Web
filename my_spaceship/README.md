## My Spaceship
***

## Task
For each exercise, you will have to create a folder and in this folder, you will have additional files that contain your work. Folder names are provided at the beginning of each exercise under submit directory and specific file names for each exercise are also provided at the beginning of each exercise under submit file(s).


## Description
You have been recently been hired by SpacePro, a new rocket manufacturer, and have been tasked with designing a simulator for their spaceships. This simulator creates a virtual “space” and keeps track of the basic movements and direction of a given ship. Your job is to keep track of where the ship is and it’s orientation relative to its starting point.

## Installation
TODO - by executing this command we can install the program npm install 


## Usage
This HTML code creates a red box with an initial position and size. The embedded JavaScript script defines a function, move_box(), that animates the box's movement towards the top-left corner by updating its right and bottom properties. The setInterval function calls move_box every 500 milliseconds, creating a continuous animation effect. The numerical variable num controls the animation by decrementing its value. The result is a dynamic visual element that gradually moves on the webpage.
